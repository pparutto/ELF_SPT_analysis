The following codes were developped in MATLAB V9.0.

Repository structure:

./analysis: scripts performing the analysis presented in the paper:
    + show_trajectories.m: display trajectories and inst. vel. histograms
    + show_maps.m: display density/diffusion maps and hist. of diff. coeffs.
    + junction_confinement.m: estimate confinement parameters of ER junctions
./data: STPs in mat format.
./experiments: Experimental & analysis parameters.
./functions: supporting functions.

Code is self-contained and was tested on windows & linux.
